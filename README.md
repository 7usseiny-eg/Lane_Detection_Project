# Lane_Detection_Project

## Introduction
  * A simple digital image processing project for detecting the lanes and cars across the road. This project has two parts, first part is the notebook based code whereas the second part is the python file run with a three possible arguments, one for the image file path and the other for the video file path and last is the debugging mode

## Requirements
 * For this project to take said image/video and work, you have to download a single folder and place it along with your run.py file in the same folder.
 * The folder will be found inside the repo named camera_cal.
 * You should NOT change any of the names of either camera_cal or the contents inside of it.

## Debugging Mode
  * Debugging mode is used to know the stages of how the output video was released.
  * You can enable the debugging mode on running by using '1' argument or disable it by not inserting or inserting '0' as an argument
  * For the debugging mode, we show 4 different stages as following:
       1. Grey Scale of the original video
       2. Bird View of the original video after transformation
